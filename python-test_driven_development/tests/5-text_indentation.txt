How to Use 5-text_indentation.py
===================================

This module defines a text formatting function ``text_indentation(text)``.

Usage
=====

``text_indentation(...)`` prints text with 2 new lines after `.`, `?`, and `:`.

::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text = "Hello. How are you? I am fine: thank you."
    >>> text_indentation(text)
    Hello.

    How are you?

    I am fine:

    thank you.

Extra spaces after `.` `?` `:` should be removed.

::

    >>> text = "This is a sentence.  Another one?    Here is more:  Yes!"
    >>> text_indentation(text)
    This is a sentence.

    Another one?

    Here is more:

    Yes!

Invalid Inputs
=============

Only strings are allowed. Otherwise, a `TypeError` is raised.

::

    >>> text_indentation(123)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

::

    >>> text_indentation(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):

``text_indentation("")`` should print nothing.

::

    >>> text_indentation("")
    
``text_indentation("Only words")`` should print the text without extra formatting.

    >>> text_indentation("Only words")
    Only words
